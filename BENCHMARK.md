# Elmdb Multi-Process Mega Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark suite for testing elmdb's massive concurrency capabilities with real-world workloads.

## Overview

The Multi-Process Mega Benchmark (`multi_process_benchmark.erl`) tests elmdb's ability to handle enterprise-scale concurrent operations. It simulates realistic database workloads with multiple writers, readers, and cursor-based operations running simultaneously.

## Benchmark Configuration

**44 Concurrent Processes:**
- **16 Writer Processes**: Each writing 250k records (4M total writes)
- **20 Reader Processes**: Each performing 250k reads (5M total reads)
- **8 Lister Processes**: Each doing 5 full database scans via cursors

**Database Setup:**
- Pre-populated with 1M base records
- 20GB memory map for large-scale operations
- 200 max concurrent readers
- Optimized flags: `no_read_ahead`, `no_sync`, `no_meta_sync`

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Concurrent Multi-Writing**
- 16 writers simultaneously add 4M records
- Each writer uses unique key ranges to avoid conflicts
- Tests LMDB's single-writer architecture with process-level parallelism

### 2. **Mixed Read Patterns**
- Readers access pre-populated data, newly written records, and random keys
- Tests read performance under heavy write load
- Simulates real-world cache hit/miss scenarios

### 3. **Cursor Operations Under Load**
- Multiple cursor processes iterate through database while writes occur
- Tests MVCC snapshot consistency during concurrent updates
- Validates cursor performance with large datasets

### 4. **Realistic Data Characteristics**
- Variable-size records (200-500 bytes)
- Random content with timestamps
- Simulated network delays and processing patterns

## Running the Benchmark

### Prerequisites

1. **Build elmdb:**
   ```bash
   rebar3 compile
   ```

2. **Ensure sufficient system resources:**
   - At least 8GB available RAM
   - 20GB free disk space for memory mapping
   - Multi-core CPU recommended for best results

### Execution

```bash
# Compile the benchmark
erlc multi_process_benchmark.erl

# Run the complete benchmark suite
erl -noshell -pa _build/default/lib/elmdb/ebin -eval "multi_process_benchmark:run(), halt()."
```

### Alternative Execution Methods

**Interactive Erlang Shell:**
```erlang
% Start Erlang with proper paths
erl -pa _build/default/lib/elmdb/ebin

% In the shell:
c(multi_process_benchmark).
multi_process_benchmark:run().
```

**Custom Configuration:**
```erlang
% Run just the stress test component
multi_process_benchmark:mega_stress_test().
```

## Expected Results

### Performance Benchmarks

**Typical Results (varies by hardware):**
- **Total Operations**: 8.8M+ operations

- **Write Throughput**: 50-55k ops/sec
- **Read Throughput**: 15-20k ops/sec
- **Cursor Throughput**: 40-50k ops/sec

### Process-Level Performance

**Individual Process Averages:**
- **Writers**: 3,400-3,600 ops/sec per process
- **Readers**: 4,200-4,500 ops/sec per process
